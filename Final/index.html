            <h2>Welcome to The Pitbull Haven!</h2>
            <p>We, The Pitbull Haven, was founded in November 2021 as a non-profit rescue and sanctuary. Though we are based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we have outreach throughout the United States. The Pitbull Haven works with many rescues, shelters, and sanctuaries to create a network to help as many of the bully breed as we can. We are all volunteers and give our time and resources for the sole purpose of helping the breed and education of the breed. The Pitbull Haven's mission is to educate the true nature of the dogs labeled pit bulls in an effort to restore their reputation. We offer a safe place for the homeless, abused, abandoned, and forgotten. We work with the animals and search for loving and responsible forever homes for the dogs that we help and offer a place for those that cannot be placed in a home.</p>

          <h3>The Term: Pit Bull</h3>
          <p>While ”Pit Bull” is NOT a breed. It is a well-known generic term that is often used to describe all dogs with similar traits and characteristics known to the public as "pit bulls." When we use the term “pit bull” here, it should be understood to encompass all the bully breeds and mixed bully breeds. While the American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is the only formal breed with the term "pit bull" in its name, there are four breeds that are commonly included in the modern pit bull-type category. The American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and the American Bully are those breeds. However, there are easily over 20 other unique bully breeds and even more mixed breeds that share the same or similar physical characteristics that are common to dogs included in the pit bull-type category.</p>
                  
          <p>Historically, "pit bull" was an informal and slang label used to describe any dog that was subjected to the cruel sport of bull-baiting - using dogs (of any breed) to seize tethered animals such as bulls within an enclosed area called a "pit" (thus the term "pit bull"). Although dogs that resemble today's bully breeds were commonly used for this "sport", many different breeds and mixes were also subjected to this inhumane activity; therefore, it was not a sport limited to today's pitbull-type breeds. In other words, "pit bull" was more of a label to describe any dog that was used for bull-baiting and less of a label used to describe a specific breed or type of dog (technically, if a Husky had been used for baiting a bull in a pit it would have been considered a "pit bull" back then). Furthermore, baiting is not an inherent trait for any breed, it's an activity that must be taught and honed, no different than training a dog to sit or fetch.</p>
